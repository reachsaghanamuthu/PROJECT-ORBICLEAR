# PROJECT-ORBICLEAR
ORBICLEAR is a smart debris-removal satellite that captures defunct satellites in Low Earth Orbit and guides them safely back to Earth for controlled reentry. With its robotic arm, sensors, and solar-powered system, it ensures a cleaner and safer orbital environment for future space missions.
